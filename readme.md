# Beeps ðŸ¦š

An example of a micro blog app.

See the **[demo]** or create your own instance of the app:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)


## Dev

Run the backend:
```
$ composer serve
```

Run the client:
```
$ cd src/client
$ yarn serve
```


Test the API:
```
$ composer test
```


Deploy to heroku:
```
$ git push heroku trunk:main --force
```


## Tech

Main stuff:
- [Slim] (v4)
- [Vue]
- [Bulma]
- [Auth Middleware]
- [Cumulus]
- [Wire Genie]
- [dibi]
- [Avatars]


## Why

ðŸš§ The blog post is being prepared...


## Todos

- [ ] wire genie DI bridge
- [ ] remove/update owned "beeps" `DELETE/PATCH /beeps/{id}`

The app is missing many other important things,
like proper serializers, error handling, automated client app deployment and other stuff.
Nevertheless, it's a solid source of knowledge for starting developers, I think.


## Contributing

Sure, I'll accept PRs and issues.
